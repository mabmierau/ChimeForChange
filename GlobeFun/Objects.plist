			<string>Open Schools for Brave Girls in Pakistan</string>
			<key>Type</key>
			<string>Project</string>
			<key>Contents</key>
			<string>This project allows you to play a part by helping BRAC eradicate illiteracy in Pakistan and foster the future success of thousands of Pakistani girls and women. Girls make up a majority of all BRAC classrooms. We’re the world’s largest implementer of “the girl effect,” the unique role that girls and women can play as positive agents of change in their societies and the world.
In some areas of the country, girls like Malala are discouraged from attending schools on religious grounds, and face serious life risks when challenging this ruling. BRAC combats these attitudes by working closely with community leaders, including religious leaders, to teach them the importance of girls’ education. With origins and experience in Bangladesh, a mainly Muslim country, BRAC has more maneuvering space in these sensitive cultural contexts.
With teaching methods that motivate the children to think critically, girls from poor backgrounds will become accomplished and influential members in their society and country. Specifically, this project will help purchase books for up to 3,300 students and offer pre-primary teacher training for 100 local women. Local women will be taught the importance of social and emotional learning in early childhood development – for example, creativity, play, good social skills and other building blocks for future development.
The project will operate in districts with little or no formal government pre-primary schools in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, the most populous and poorest province in the country.
Globally, more than 95% of the children who have attended BRAC’s early childhood education centers have graduated to mainstream primary schools and have outperformed their peers. The BRAC education methodology is a proven one, written about in The New York Times. An antipoverty organization, BRAC is also the world’s largest secular nongovernmental education provider, with more than a million students enrolled in its schools in six countries. The writer Nicholas Kristof tweeted that BRAC is “the best aid group you&apos;ve never heard of.”</string>

			<string>How I Use Cell Phones to Bridge the Gap for the Voiceless</string>
			<key>Contents</key>
			<string>Recently, I met Jyoti Bairagi - a 20 year old woman living in a remote village in India’s Madhya Pradesh state.

The village, perched on a rocky hill, had no motorable road and no running water. Everyone there wanted a boy and, when a woman gave birth to more than one girl child, it was killed. A girl’s education stopped at 5th standard, because the high school was 5 hours away, and after school, a girl would return home in pitch dark, thus running the risk of being molested. In few years, she was married off, as parents felt, she sat idle for way too long. This often resulted in early motherhood, post-natal sickness and infant mortality. The state had the highest rate of infant mortality and the worst sex ratio (888 girls to every 1000 boys) in India.

Jyoti didn’t want to get married early. She had heard that outside her village girls went to college and worked in offices. She wanted to be one of them. But first, she wanted her village to be connected with the world, and learn of those changes.

But how?

The concept of media didn’t exist; no reporter ever visited the village – over 2 hours’ walk from the nearest bus station. Nobody had a TV or bought newspapers.

But we had technology!

I was heading a program where underprivileged communities were trained to produce their own news. I spoke to a few mobile phone service providers. Jyoti’s village had a network!

‘A cell phone is all you need’ I told her.

Jyoti travelled to my office in Goa. There I helped her buy a mobile handset. In the next 2 weeks, besides basic Internet use, Facebook and Twitter, Jyoti learnt to subscribe to a free SMS service. She learned to type a Hindi text message in Roman script and write a micro-report using no more than 140 characters. Next, Jyoti learnt to send the SMS to a group of people. Each time, she could reach 145 people. I showed her how to add in that group, people who mattered: journalists, activists, Government officials and police officers. Most of them were active users of social media and could, through re-twits and re-posting, help take Jyoti’s hyper local reports to a pan-global audience.

Four days after she left Goa, Jyoti sent us her first news report:

‘I am in village. With me, my village has got its own media.&apos;

To me, this is what technology is all about: empowering one woman to help empower another, bridging the gap between the urban and the rural and, the vocal and the voiceless.

Waiting out there are millions of Jyotis. I strive to reach them all with technology, so, no injustice against them ever goes untold.</string>

			<string>Win Back 6 Weeks of School Per Year for Girls in Kenya</string>
			<key>Type</key>
			<string>Project</string>
			<key>Contents</key>
			<string>$15 a year keeps a girl in school anywhere in Kenya. This $15 gives her 120 pads, three underpants, and standardized health education.
News reports show girls are often forced to choose to stay home or engage in transactional sex to afford pads. One million girls in Kenya are in this situation. We think this is a human rights issue.
Providing pads plus health education reclaims 6 weeks of school, helping girls to graduate and step into the promise of their future.
Our goal is 10,000 girls by January – starting here with 1,000 girls.
Our process innovation combines three critical components. First, we are innovating a locally made, radically affordable sanitary pad to sustainably support girls and women. Rather than using expensive wood pulp, which is what is in current sanitary pads, we have created an absorbent layer made from non-wood fibers reducing the cost of the pads 40%.
Second, with the Egyptian-based textile company, Transformation Textiles, we are also innovating inexpensive cotton underpants by making underpants from excess quality fabrics that would have been discarded.
Last, our comic-based health pamphlets, distributed in pad packages, provide vital information in a fun, standardized way that girls can read in private, refer, back to, and share with friends and family.
Through this project, we will distribute 120,000 sanitary pads and 3,000 underpants to 1,000 girls, starting in January 2014-- the commencement of the Kenyan school year. This is 10% of our 2014 goal.
We’ll continue our work in pad distribution with vetted grass-roots partner organizations, which mentor and support girls in their communities. These include organizations such as Lifting the Barriers, Mully Children’s Family and Path to Womanhood. You&apos;ll be able to track distribution activities that you&apos;ve made possible through our mobile app.
This year we distributed 6,500 annual supplies of pads, underpants, and health education. With your help, lets make a big step toward serving 1,000 more girls in January 2014.</string>
